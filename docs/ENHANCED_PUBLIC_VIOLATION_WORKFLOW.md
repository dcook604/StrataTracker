# Enhanced Public Violation Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Public Violation Workflow provides owners and tenants with a comprehensive interface to view and manage violations associated with their unit. After authenticating via email verification codes, users gain access to a full navigation interface similar to regular authenticated users, but restricted to their specific unit data.

## System Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Public User Sessions** - Session management for authenticated owners/tenants
2. **Enhanced Navigation** - Sidebar with violations section for unit-specific data
3. **Restricted API Access** - Unit-scoped data access with session-based authentication
4. **Email Integration** - Continues to use existing email verification system

### Authentication Flow

```
1. Owner/Tenant receives violation notification email
2. Clicks dispute link (existing flow)
3. Selects their name from list
4. Receives 6-digit verification code via email
5. Enters code to authenticate
6. ✨ NEW: Session created, redirected to full violations interface
7. Can now view ALL violations for their unit
8. Session expires after 24 hours
```

## Database Schema

### New Table: `public_user_sessions`

```sql
CREATE TABLE public_user_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() UNIQUE,
    person_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES persons(id),
    unit_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES property_units(id),
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'tenant')),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_accessed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Public Authentication Endpoints

- `GET /public/violation/:token/status` - Check access link status
- `POST /public/violation/:token/send-code` - Send verification code
- `POST /public/violation/:token/verify-code` - Verify code and create session

### Authenticated Public Endpoints

All require `X-Public-Session-Id` header:

- `GET /public/violations` - List all violations for authenticated user's unit
- `GET /public/violations/:id` - Get specific violation details (unit-scoped)
- `POST /public/violations/:id/dispute` - Submit dispute for violation
- `POST /public/logout` - End session

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components

1. **PublicAuthProvider** (`client/src/hooks/use-public-auth.tsx`)
   - Manages public user authentication state
   - Provides session management and API request wrapper
   - Handles localStorage persistence

2. **PublicSidebar** (`client/src/components/public-sidebar.tsx`)
   - Simplified navigation for public users
   - Shows user info (name, unit, role)
   - Violations section with "All Violations" submenu

3. **Enhanced Pages**
   - `EnhancedPublicViolationPage` - Upgraded dispute submission with full interface
   - `PublicViolationsPage` - Comprehensive violations list for unit

### User Experience Features

- **Session Persistence** - Sessions stored in localStorage for convenience
- **Unit Context** - All data scoped to authenticated user's unit
- **Clean Navigation** - Familiar sidebar interface similar to admin users
- **Secure Logout** - "End Session" button with backend session termination

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Sessions tied to specific person and unit
- All API calls validate session and unit ownership
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Email verification required for initial authentication

### Data Protection
- Only unit-specific violations visible
- Sensitive violation history filtered out
- No access to admin functions or other units' data
- Rate limiting on public endpoints

## Implementation Benefits

### For Owners/Tenants
- ✅ View complete violation history for their unit
- ✅ See status updates and progression of all violations
- ✅ Better understanding of compliance patterns
- ✅ Familiar, intuitive interface
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

### For Administrators
- ✅ Reduced support requests about violation status
- ✅ Better transparency builds trust
- ✅ Maintains existing security model
- ✅ No changes to admin workflow required

### For System
- ✅ Leverages existing email verification infrastructure
- ✅ Clean separation between public and admin interfaces
- ✅ Scalable session management
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing violation dispute flow

## Configuration

### Session Management
- **Default session duration**: 24 hours
- **Cleanup frequency**: Sessions are validated on each request
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with indexed lookups

### Rate Limiting
- **Public endpoints**: 50 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authenticated endpoints**: Validated by session, no additional limits

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Run migration 0005_public_user_sessions.sql
2. Update shared/schema.ts with new table definition

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
1. Add public-violations routes
2. Update storage layer with session management methods
3. Register routes in main routes.ts

### Phase 3: Frontend Enhancement
1. Create public auth hooks and components
2. Build public sidebar and violations pages
3. Update App.tsx with new routes and providers

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
1. Test complete authentication flow
2. Verify data isolation between units
3. Validate session management and cleanup
4. Deploy and monitor usage

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Unit Overview Dashboard** - Summary statistics for unit
- **Document Access** - View bylaw documents relevant to violations
- **Communication History** - Access to official correspondence
- **Fine Payment Integration** - Online payment capabilities
- **Mobile App** - Dedicated mobile application

### Analytics Opportunities
- Track engagement with public interface
- Monitor dispute resolution patterns
- Measure user satisfaction improvements
- Identify frequently disputed violation types

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Session creation and expiration metrics
- API usage patterns for public endpoints
- Error rates and common issues

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular cleanup of expired sessions
- Monitor storage performance with session table growth
- Review and optimize query performance

### User Support
- Clear documentation for owners/tenants
- Help text within the interface
- Contact information for technical support
