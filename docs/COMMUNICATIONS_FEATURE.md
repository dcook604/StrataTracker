## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Communication campaigns
communication_campaigns (
  id, uuid, title, type, status, subject, content,
  plain_text_content, scheduled_at, sent_at, 
  created_by_id, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Campaign recipients with delivery tracking
communication_recipients (
  id, campaign_id, recipient_type, unit_id, person_id,
  email, recipient_name, status, sent_at, error_message, created_at
)

-- Reusable email templates
communication_templates (
  id, uuid, name, type, subject, content,
  is_default, created_by_id, created_at, updated_at
)
```

### API Endpoints

#### Campaign Management
```http
GET    /api/communications/campaigns           # List all campaigns
GET    /api/communications/campaigns/:id       # Get specific campaign
POST   /api/communications/campaigns           # Create new campaign
PUT    /api/communications/campaigns/:id       # Update campaign
POST   /api/communications/campaigns/:id/send  # Send campaign
```

#### Template Management
```http
GET    /api/communications/templates    # List all templates
POST   /api/communications/templates    # Create new template
PUT    /api/communications/templates/:id # Update template
DELETE /api/communications/templates/:id # Delete template
```

#### Recipient Management
```http
POST   /api/communications/recipients/preview  # Preview recipients
GET    /api/communications/units              # Get available units
```

## üîß Configuration & Setup

### SMTP Integration

The Communications feature automatically uses SMTP settings configured in the system settings page. No additional configuration is required.

#### SMTP Configuration Format
SMTP settings are stored in the `system_settings` table as JSON:

```json
{
  "host": "smtp.example.com",
  "port": 587,
  "secure": false,
  "auth": {
    "user": "your-email@example.com",
    "pass": "your-password"
  },
  "from": "noreply@yourcompany.com"
}
```

#### Email Service Integration
```typescript
// Automatically loads SMTP configuration from database
const config = await loadEmailSettings();

// Uses configured SMTP for all communications
await sendEmail({
  to: recipient.email,
  subject: campaign.subject,
  html: campaign.content,
  text: campaign.plainTextContent
});
```

### Development Setup

**Critical**: Always use the startup script for development:

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
sh start-dev.sh

# This script:
# - Finds available ports automatically
# - Starts backend on port 3001 (or next available)
# - Starts frontend on next available port
# - Provides proper cleanup on exit
```

### Database Migration

```bash
# Apply communications migration (usually automatic)
sudo docker exec -i stratatracker-db-1 psql -U spectrum4 -d spectrum4 < migrations/0003_communications_schema.sql

# Verify tables were created
sudo docker exec -i stratatracker-db-1 psql -U spectrum4 -d spectrum4 -c "\\dt" | grep communication
```

## üîê Security & Access Control

### Authentication Requirements
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and Council members only
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Uses existing session management
- **API Security**: All endpoints require authentication

### Data Protection
- **Email Validation**: All email addresses validated before sending
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS protection on all inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Audit Trail**: All campaign creation tracked with user attribution

### Access Control Implementation
```typescript
const ensureCouncilOrAdmin = (req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated() && req.user && 
      (req.user.isCouncilMember || req.user.isAdmin)) {
    return next();
  }
  res.status(403).json({ message: "Forbidden - Admin or Council access required" });
};
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Email Delivery Problems
```bash
# Check SMTP configuration
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/settings/email_config

# Verify email service is loaded
# Check application logs for email service errors
sudo docker compose logs backend | grep -i email
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify communications tables exist
sudo docker exec -i stratatracker-db-1 psql -U spectrum4 -d spectrum4 -c "\\dt" | grep communication

# Check table structure
sudo docker exec -i stratatracker-db-1 psql -U spectrum4 -d spectrum4 -c "\\d communication_campaigns"
```

#### API Access Problems
```bash
# Test API authentication
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3001/api/communications/campaigns
# Should return 403 (Forbidden) if not authenticated
# Should return 200 with data if properly authenticated
```

#### Frontend Loading Issues
```bash
# Verify frontend is accessible
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5175/communications
# Should return 200

# Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
# Ensure user has Admin or Council member permissions
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Email Delivery
- Check SMTP server response times
- Verify email content size (large HTML/images slow delivery)
- Monitor network connectivity to SMTP server
- Consider reducing recipient batch sizes

#### Database Performance
- Check recipient query performance for large unit counts
- Monitor database connection pool usage
- Verify indexes are in place on foreign keys

### Error Resolution

#### Failed Email Deliveries
1. Check error messages in campaign recipient details
2. Verify SMTP credentials are correct
3. Check recipient email addresses for validity
4. Monitor SMTP server logs if accessible

#### Template/Campaign Creation Failures
1. Verify user has proper permissions (Admin/Council)
2. Check input validation errors
3. Ensure database connectivity
4. Review application logs for specific errors
