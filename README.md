---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo>
   ```
2. **Copy and configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required values (see below).
3. **Start the app with Docker Compose**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - The backend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - PostgreSQL will run on port 5432 (see `docker-compose.yml` for credentials)
4. **First-time setup:**
   - The database will be initialized with an admin user (see `db/init/01-init.sql`).
   - **Important:** Replace the default admin password hash in `01-init.sql` with a bcrypt hash of your own password before deploying to production.

- Full Canadian address support, multiple property managers/caretakers/council
- Email notification toggles and SMTP settings

---

## Requirements (for non-Docker/manual setup)

- **Node.js**: >=18.x
- **npm**: >=9.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Other**:
  - [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) (for process management)
  - [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/) (if running TypeScript directly)
  - SMTP server (for email notifications)

---

## Manual Setup (Alternative to Docker)

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required values.
3. **Build the app**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Run in development**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Run in production (recommended: PM2)**
   ```sh
   pm2 start dist/index.js --name spectrum4
   # or, for TypeScript:
   pm2 start server/index.ts --name spectrum4 --interpreter $(which ts-node)
   ```

---

## Database Initialization
- On first run with Docker Compose, the database is initialized using scripts in `db/init/`.
- The default script (`01-init.sql`) creates an admin user. **Replace the bcrypt hash with your own password hash before production.**
- You can add more SQL scripts to this directory for further initialization.

---

## Deployment & Production Notes
- **HTTPS**: Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) for SSL.
- **Static files**: Served from `client/public/` (including evidence uploads).
- **PWA**: Manifest and icons included; app is installable.
- **Process management**: Use PM2 or Docker for zero-downtime restarts and monitoring.
- **Backups**: Regularly back up your PostgreSQL volume/data.
- **Environment variables**: Never commit secrets; use `.env` and `.env.example`.

---

## Security & Best Practices
- Helmet for HTTP security headers
- CORS restricted in production
- Rate limiting enabled
- All secrets/config in `.env`
- Error boundaries in React
- Regular DB backups recommended
- **Sanitize and validate all user input**
- **Never hardcode credentials**

## Settings Page Tabs

The Settings page now includes the following tabs (visible to Administrators and Council Members):

- **Email Settings**: Configure notification sender, enable/disable notifications, customize email subjects and footer.
- **System Settings**: General system-wide preferences (future expansion).
- **SMTP Settings**: Configure the outgoing email (SMTP) server, including host, port, authentication, and sender address. Test email delivery directly from this tab.
- **User Management**: Add, edit, lock, or remove user accounts and assign roles.

**Access:** Only users with the Administrator or Council Member role can view and modify these settings. Regular users will not see the Settings page or its tabs.

## Recent Fixes & Resolutions

### Dashboard & Settings Page Stability

A series of issues affecting the Dashboard and Settings page have been resolved:

1.  **Dashboard Statistics Display:**
    *   **Issue:** Statistics cards on the Dashboard (Total Violations, New, Pending, etc.) were appearing blank.
    *   **Cause:** The `DashboardStats` component was not correctly accessing the nested `stats` object from the `/api/reports/stats` API response. The `useQuery` hook was returning the entire response object, and the component was attempting to read properties like `totalViolations` from this parent object where they were undefined.
    *   **Fix:** The `useQuery` hook in `client/src/components/dashboard-stats.tsx` was updated. An explicit `queryFn` was added that now processes the API response and returns the `jsonData.stats` object directly. This ensures the component receives the correct data structure for display.

2.  **Settings Page Crash (`TypeError: e.find is not a function`):**
    *   **Issue:** The Settings page was crashing with a "Something went wrong" message, and browser console logs showed a `TypeError: e.find is not a function`.
    *   **Primary Cause (Corrected in `settings-page.tsx`):**
        *   The `useEffect` hook responsible for populating the "System Settings" form (including strata name, address, logo, etc.) was incorrectly attempting to access `settings.settings` and `settings.logoUrl` as if the `settings` data (from `/api/settings`) was an object containing these properties. However, `settings` is an array (`SystemSetting[]`).
        *   **Fix:** The `useEffect` hook in `client/src/pages/settings-page.tsx` was modified to correctly treat `settings` as an array. It now iterates directly over `settings` to find the relevant `SystemSetting` objects (e.g., for 'strata_logo') and populates the form state and `logoUrl` state variable appropriately.

3.  **Settings Page - Dialog Accessibility Warnings:**
    *   **Issue:** Browser console logs showed accessibility warnings for `DialogContent` components (from Radix UI, via shadcn/ui) within the User Management tab of the Settings page, indicating missing `DialogTitle` or `DialogDescription` / `aria-describedby` attributes.
    *   **Fix:** Added the required `<DialogDescription>` components to the following dialogs within `client/src/components/user-management-tab.tsx`:
        *   Add/Edit User Dialog
        *   Invite User Dialog
        *   Lock/Unlock User Account Dialog
        This ensures these dialogs are more accessible to screen reader users.

4.  **Backend API Error (`/api/violations/pending-approval` - 500 Error):**
    *   **Issue:** The API endpoint `/api/violations/pending-approval` (called by the main Layout component for notification badges) was consistently returning a 500 Internal Server Error.
    *   **Resolution Note:** While the exact backend fix details were not processed here, this issue was also reported as resolved. For future reference, server logs are located in the `logs/` directory and are essential for diagnosing such backend errors. The endpoint relies on the `dbStorage.getViolationsByStatus("pending_approval")` function in `server/storage.ts`.

## Developer Notes

### Enhanced API Error Handling & Logging

To aid in debugging and provide clearer insights into backend issues, several enhancements have been made:

*   **`/api/violations/pending-approval` Route (Server-Side):**
    *   Increased verbosity in logging: Logs now include the calling user's ID at the start of a request and upon successful data retrieval.
    *   Improved error structure: In case of an error, the server logs detailed error information (message, stack, error name, timestamp) and returns a structured JSON response to the client. This JSON includes `message`, `errorCode`, `details`, and `timestamp` fields, making client-side error handling more robust.

*   **Client-Side Fetch for Pending Approvals (`client/src/components/layout.tsx`):
    *   The `fetch` call to `/api/violations/pending-approval` now rigorously checks `response.ok`.
    *   If an error occurs, it attempts to parse the structured JSON error from the server.
    *   Detailed error information (from the server or a client-generated one) is logged to the console.
    *   User-facing toast notifications are displayed to inform about failures in fetching pending approvals, using details from the error response.

### LogRocket Integration Guide

LogRocket can be integrated for advanced session replay, performance monitoring, and product analytics. This is invaluable for understanding user-affecting issues.

**General Steps:**

1.  **Account & Project Setup:**
    *   Sign up/log in at [LogRocket.com](https://logrocket.com).
    *   Create a new project in your LogRocket dashboard to obtain an **App ID** (e.g., `your-app-id/your-project-name`).

2.  **SDK Installation (in `client/` directory):**
    ```bash
    npm i --save logrocket
    npm i --save logrocket-react@6  # For React 18+, adjust version if needed
    ```

3.  **Initialization (in `client/src/main.tsx`):**
    Import and initialize LogRocket *before* your main React app renders:
    ```typescript
    import LogRocket from 'logrocket';
    import setupLogRocketReact from 'logrocket-react'; // If using the React plugin

    // REPLACE 'your-app-id/your-project-name' with your actual LogRocket App ID
    LogRocket.init('your-app-id/your-project-name');
    setupLogRocketReact(LogRocket); // Optional: if you installed logrocket-react

    // ... rest of your main.tsx (ReactDOM.createRoot, etc.)
    ```

4.  **User Identification (Optional but Recommended):**
    Associate sessions with users for better tracking. Call `LogRocket.identify()` after login or when user data is available (e.g., in `client/src/hooks/use-auth.ts`):
    ```typescript
    LogRocket.identify('USER_ID', { // Replace USER_ID with actual user's ID
      name: 'User Full Name',
      email: 'user@example.com',
      // Add any other relevant user traits
    });
    ```

5.  **Babel Plugin for `displayName` (Optional for React Plugin):
    To improve component identification in LogRocket when using `logrocket-react`, ensure components have `displayName` properties. For projects using Babel (e.g., in Vite's production build):
    *   Install: `npm i --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-react-display-name`
    *   Configure in your Babel settings (e.g., `.babelrc` or via `vite.config.ts` if customizing Vite's Babel options).

Refer to the official [LogRocket Documentation](https://docs.logrocket.com/) for more detailed setup and advanced configuration options.
