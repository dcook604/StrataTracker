## [0.0.10] - 2025-02-12

### üöÄ Major Performance & Configurability Improvements

- **Configurable Batch Processing:** Added new settings `localSnapshots.batchSize`, `localSnapshots.batchDelay`, and `localSnapshots.maxParallelBatches` to allow users to adjust snapshot processing behavior.
- **Faster Processing:** Improved parallel file processing and smarter batching by replacing hardcoded constants with configurable methods, resulting in significantly faster snapshot creation for large workspaces.
- **Enhanced Type Safety & Code Quality:** Resolved multiple linter errors by removing duplicate interface declarations and updating method signatures to ensure proper type compatibility (e.g., for progress reporting).
- **Smarter File Handling:** Implemented caching for file metadata and optimized file filtering based on ignore patterns (including .gitignore integration) and common binary file types.

üí° **Tips:**
- Adjust the new batch processing settings in the extension configuration to optimize performance for your setup.
- Leverage .gitignore integration and custom ignore patterns for even better snapshot efficiency.
